- **Prominent Display**: Direction shown in both terminal and Discord alerts
- **Strategy-Specific Logic**: Each strategy determines direction based on its unique characteristics

---

## 🔧 Implementation by Strategy

### 1. Range Trading
**Direction Logic:** Price momentum bias
- **BULLISH**: Price momentum > 0.2 → Buy support, sell resistance
- **BEARISH**: Price momentum < -0.2 → Short resistance, take profit at support
- **NEUTRAL**: Otherwise → Trade both directions equally

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: 📈 BULLISH
• 📈 BIAS: LONG near support, take profit at resistance
```

---

### 2. Scalping
**Direction Logic:** Short-term price momentum
- **BULLISH**: Price momentum > 0.15 → Favor long scalps
- **BEARISH**: Price momentum < -0.15 → Favor short scalps
- **NEUTRAL**: Otherwise → Scalp both directions

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: 📉 BEARISH
• 📉 FAVOR SHORT: Sell rips, quick profits on pullbacks
```

---

### 3. Trend Following
**Direction Logic:** Composite score direction
- **LONG**: Composite score > 0 → Go long with trailing stops
- **SHORT**: Composite score < 0 → Go short with trailing stops

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: 📈 LONG
• 📈 GO LONG with trailing stops
• Ride established uptrend
```

---

### 4. Funding Rate Arbitrage
**Direction:** Always **NEUTRAL (Delta Neutral)**
- Market-neutral spread trading
- No directional exposure

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: ⚪ NEUTRAL (Delta Neutral)
• 💰 BEST TRADE: Short Bitget / Long HyperLiquid
```

---

### 5. Contrarian Play
**Direction Logic:** Fade the crowd or extreme sentiment
- **SHORT**: Crowded long (>70%) OR extreme bullish sentiment (>0.7)
- **LONG**: Crowded short (>70%) OR extreme bearish sentiment (<-0.7)
- **UNCLEAR**: Wait for clearer extreme

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: 📉 SHORT
• 📉 GO SHORT (Fade crowded longs)
• CROWDED LONG: 72.5% of traders are long
```

---

### 6. Mean Reversion
**Direction Logic:** Fade overextended moves
- **LONG**: Price fell too far (price_score < 0) → Buy the dip
- **SHORT**: Price rose too far (price_score > 0) → Fade the rip

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: 📈 LONG
• 📈 GO LONG (Buy the dip, price fell too far)
```

---

### 7. Breakout Trading
**Direction Logic:** Bias even during consolidation
- **BULLISH**: Score > 0.1 OR (price momentum > 0.1 AND funding > 0)
- **BEARISH**: Score < -0.1 OR (price momentum < -0.1 AND funding < 0)
- **BOTH**: Otherwise → Watch both sides

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: ⚖️ BOTH
• ⚖️ WATCH BOTH SIDES (buy-stops above, sell-stops below)
```

---

### 8. Liquidation Cascade Risk
**Direction Logic:** Counter-position opportunity (opposite of risk)
- **SHORT**: If longs at risk (score > 0)
- **LONG**: If shorts at risk (score < 0)

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: 📉 SHORT
• 📉 Counter with SHORT with tight stops
• Longs heavily leveraged (OI/Vol: 0.65x)
```

---

### 9. Volatility Expansion
**Direction:** Always **BOTH (Non-Directional)**
- Straddle/strangle strategy
- Profit from movement in EITHER direction

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: ⚖️ BOTH (Non-Directional)
• 📊 TRADE BOTH SIDES: Straddle/strangle OR wide bracket orders
• Profit from expansion in EITHER direction
```

---

### 10. Momentum Breakout
**Direction Logic:** Follow the acceleration
- **LONG**: Price change > 0 → Ride long momentum
- **SHORT**: Price change < 0 → Ride short momentum

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: 📈 LONG
• 📈 RIDE LONG momentum with wide stops
• Strong bullish acceleration (6.2%)
```

---

### 11. Delta Neutral / Market Making
**Direction:** Always **NEUTRAL (Delta Neutral)**
- Market-neutral by definition
- Hedge both sides

**Example Output:**
```
Direction: ⚪ NEUTRAL (Delta Neutral)
• ⚖️ MARKET-NEUTRAL positioning (hedge both sides)
```
